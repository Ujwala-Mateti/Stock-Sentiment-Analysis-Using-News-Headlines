# Stock-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-News-Headlines
## Overview
This project was developed as part of my academic coursework to explore the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in finance. The objective was to analyze stock market news headlines and classify them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories. 
The project demonstrates skills in text preprocessing, sentiment scoring, and predictive modeling using machine learning techniques.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to use sentiment analysis to help understand how public news sentiment may influence stock market trends. By converting unstructured text data into numerical features, the project builds a model to classify sentiments effectively.

## Dataset
Source: Kaggle(Stock Sentiment Anlaysis using News Headlines)

## Techniques
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text preprocessing and feature extraction  
* Sentiment analysis using classical ML models
* Model training and evaluation with algorithms like XG Boost, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
* Visualization of sentiment trends over time

## Libraries & Tools
* Data Processing: pandas, numpy
* NLP & Sentiment Analysis: nltk, scikit-learn, xgboost
* Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
* Environment: Jupyter Notebook

## Results
Compared to all the classifiers Na√Øve Bayes performed well with accuracy 85%.
